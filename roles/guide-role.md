# Guide Role

## Overview

The Guide is the owner of the consulting process at Gaslight. You're a
liaison, a manager and a mentor all at the same time. You're focused on
managing the development process for all of our projects. You're constantly
looking for better measurements and ways to improve both communication and
throughput.

You're the main point of contact for our clients, so communication skills are
vital. The Guide is organized and detail oriented. You're the timekeeper for
meetings and standups related to the project, so scheduling is a large part of
the day to day activity.

Although you're intimately involved in software projects, development skills
aren't required. Familiarity with software projects is required, though.

You're familiar with Scrum and Kanban. We're not bound to either, but hope to
extract the best of all worlds into our process.

You'll maintain the documentation about the process, reviewing and revising as
needed. Documenting the process makes it easy for all of us (clients and
product owners included) to understand how projects are managed. We'll make
that documentation available publicly as well.
